# Docker Compose - Local Development Configuration
# This is a reference to the actual file in deployment/docker/
# Use: docker-compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up

# For local development setup with just PostgreSQL + Redis:
# docker-compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# For full stack with monitoring:
# docker-compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Or use the Makefile:
# make docker-up-dev    (starts development stack)
# make docker-up-prod   (starts production stack)
# make docker-down      (stops all containers)

version: "3.9"

services:
  # Redirect to development compose file
  # See: deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml
  note:
    image: alpine:latest
    command: echo "Please use deployment/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml for local development"
