## ✅ What Changed

### Docker Files
- **Before**: `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.local.yml` in root
- **After**: ✅ Moved to `deployment/docker/` where they belong

### Documentation Files
- **Before**: Scattered across root and docs/ folder
- **After**: ✅ Organized into logical subfolders in docs/

| What | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Setup docs | Root | docs/setup/ |
| API docs | docs/ root | docs/api/ |
| Deployment | Root | docs/deployment/ |
| Monitoring & troubleshooting | docs/ root | docs/operations/ |
| Contributing & code structure | Root | docs/development/ |
| Architecture | docs/ root | docs/architecture/ |
| Docker files | Root | deployment/docker/ |

---

## 🚀 Benefits

✅ **Clean Root**: Only essential files in project root (README, run.py, etc.)
✅ **Logical Organization**: Files grouped by topic, not mixed together
✅ **Easy Navigation**: docs/INDEX.md shows where everything is
✅ **Professional Structure**: Matches industry best practices
✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new docs or features
✅ **Reduced Clutter**: No red flag files in main folder
